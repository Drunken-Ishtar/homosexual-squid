IMPORTANT: STANDARDIZE DATABASE NAME AS SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE. 
    PROBABLY ALSO IMPORTANT: MAKE AN ACTUAL README SO THAT ISRA AND THE OTHERS CAN ACTUALLY USE THIS THING

REMEMBER : ADD TRIGGERS AND CHANGELOG TABLES 

Quick include top and bottom:

    <?php include 'top.html';?>

    <?php include 'bottom.html';?>

    backlog tables: Should be working, emphasis on the should
    triggers: not started, backlog and changelog tables are directly dependent on these things tho
    changelog tables: Not sure if needed
